         Quality of Service Extension Block for Bundle Protocol
                      draft-algarra-dtn-qos-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a Quality of Service (QoS) Extension Block for
   the Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7).  The QoS Extension Block
   enables users to request and indicate QoS parameters, such as traffic
   prioritization, retransmission, latest-only delivery, and bundle
   retention preference.  The purpose of this extension is to enhance
   the efficiency of bundle forwarding and delivery according to user
   requirements while maintaining interoperability with existing BP
   implementations.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the structure of an extension block for
   Bundle Protocol Version 7 (BPv7) as defined in [RFC9171].  It can be
   added to a bundle to signal user-requested QoS parameters which
   indicate to the nodes how to handle the bundle based on the desired
   QoS characteristics.

   QoS mechanisms enhance the efficiency of communications over
   constrained networks by prioritizing traffic, reducing unnecessary
   retransmissions, and enabling context-aware bundle handling.  In
   environments like space, latencies are high, contacts intermittent
   and bandwidth and storage limited, making QoS signaling essential to
   effective resource management.

   BPv7 does not include intrinsic QoS signaling, so there is therefore
   a need for a standardized manner for QoS preferences to be indicated.
   The QoS parameters supported by this specification include:

   *  Traffic Priority: bundle forwarding precedence.

   *  Retransmission: desired use of reliable or unreliable convergence
      layers and underlying protocols.

   *  Latest-Only Delivery: indication to drop outdated information from
      the same flow.

   *  Bundle Storage: deletion order preference when node storage is
      full.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Description

3.1.  Definitions

   *  User: entity or set of entities operating under the same SLA using
      the network for sending data from a single or multiple sources to
      a single or multiple destinations.

   *  Priority class: level of urgency assigned to a bundle, helping to
      determine the order in which it should be forwarded.

   *  Sub-priority class: secondary level of prioritization used to
      further classify bundles within a main priority class, adding
      granularity based on relative urgency within a priority class.

   *  Transmission volume: aggregate total size of bundles transmitted
      across a link, measured in bytes.

3.2.  Extension Block Description

   The User QoS Extension Block (UQEB) MUST follow the canonical bundle
   block format defined in [RFC9171].  The UQEB MUST be added only by
   the source node of a bundle.  The UQEB MUST NOT be modified by any
   other node.  Integrity and authentication MUST be ensured for the
   extension block.  A Bundle Integrity Block (BIB) as defined in
   [RFC9172] MAY be used, unless an external system can guarantee the
   same results.

   There will be an image here.

   The block type code MUST be assigned.  The block processing control
   flags Bit 1, Bit 2 and Bit 4 MAY be set to ‘0’ to allow bundle nodes
   not supporting this extension block to pass it transparently.  The
   block-type-specific data MUST be encoded as a definite-length CBOR
   [RFC8949] byte string containing a definite-length CBOR map, with
   each map key identifying a QoS parameter, and the associated value
   specifying its setting.  A new IANA registry, "UQEB Parameters", is
   defined for the registration of QoS parameters and the associated
   values; see Section 5.1.  Each QoS parameter MAY appear if needed,
   but does not need to.  Each QoS parameter MUST NOT appear more than
   once.

   There will be an image here.

3.3.  QoS Parameters

3.3.1.  Traffic Priority

   Traffic Priority (value 0 in the QoS Parameter Registry in
   Section 5.1) determines the forwarding order when multiple bundles
   are queued.  A new IANA registry, "QoS Traffic Priority", is defined
   for the registration of traffic prioritization classes and the
   associated values; see Section 5.2.  Bundles marked as expedited
   (value 0 in the QoS Traffic Priority Registry in Section 5.2) MUST be
   forwarded before any other bundles from the same user.  Bundles
   marked normal (values 1 to 4 in the QoS Traffic Priority Registry in
   Section 5.2) MUST be forwarded before bulk bundles from that user.
   Bundles marked bulk (values 5 to 8 in the QoS Traffic Priority
   Registry in Section 5.2) MUST NOT be forwarded if expedited or normal
   bundles from the user are present.  In the case of several bundles
   with the same priority class and the same sub-priority class, they
   SHOULD be forwarded in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) basis.  In the
   case of several bundles with the same priority class but different
   sub-priority classes, priority MUST decrease in ascending order.  A
   volume-based fair scheduling algorithm MAY be used to avoid data
   starvation.  Priorities SHOULD be used to inform the selection of
   parameters for underlying convergence layers if those implement
   priority schemes.  Bundles without a priority marking MUST be treated
   as having value 5 (default bulk).

3.3.2.  Retransmission

   The retransmission parameter (value 1 in the QoS Parameter Registry
   in Section 5.1) defines whether an underlying protocol stack that
   provides retransmission shall be used.  A new IANA registry, "QoS
   Retransmission Requirement", is defined for the registration of
   retransmission requirements and the associated values; see
   Section 5.3.  Bundles marked as retransmission required (value 1 in
   the QoS Retransmission Requirement in Section 5.3) MUST be dispatched
   via a protocol stack which applies retransmission in case of data
   loss.  Bundles marked as retransmission if possible (value 2 in the
   QoS Retransmission Requirement in Section 5.3) MAY be dispatched via
   a protocol stack which applies retransmission in case of data loss if
   currently available, and via a protocol stack which doesn’t if none
   is available.  Bundles marked as no retransmission allowed (value -1
   in the QoS Retransmission Requirement in Section 5.3) MUST be
   dispatched via a protocol stack which does not apply retransmission
   in case of data loss.  Bundles marked as no retransmission if
   possible (value -2 in the QoS Retransmission Requirement in
   Section 5.3) SHOULD be dispatched via a protocol stack which does not
   apply retransmission in case of data loss if currently available, and
   via a protocol stack which does if none is available.  Bundles
   without a retransmission marking or where the indication is
   unspecified (value 0 in the QoS Retransmission Requirement in
   Section 5.3), the implementation SHOULD use the default option
   available.

3.3.3.  Latest-Only Delivery

   Latest-only delivery (value 2 in the QoS Parameter Registry in
   Section 5.1) prevents the transmission of old information if newer
   information is available.  A new IANA registry, "QoS Latest-Only
   Delivery", is defined for the registration of retransmission
   requirements and the associated values; see Section 5.4.  Bundles
   marked as all (value 0 in the QoS Latest-Only Delivery Registry in
   Section 5.4) MUST proceed as usual.  Bundles marked as latest-only
   (value 1 in the QoS Latest-Only Delivery Registry in Section 5.4)
   MUST be discarded if a bundle with the same source node ID,
   destination endpoint ID, and a newer creation time is available.
   Bundles without a lates-only marking MUST be treated as having value
   0 (all).  The latest bundle MUST be forwarded at the time the oldest
   discarded bundle would have been forwarded.

3.3.4.  Bundle Retention

   The bundle retention parameter (value 3 in the QoS Parameter Registry
   in Section 5.1) indicates the deletion order if a node runs out of
   storage for the user.  A new IANA registry, "QoS Bundle Retention",
   is defined for the registration of retransmission requirements and
   the associated values; see Section 5.5.  Bundles marked as a certain
   class MUST NOT be deleted if bundles with a higher class value are in
   the storage.  In case of several bundles of the same class, deletion
   MUST be performed starting with the shortest time to live left.
   Bundles without a bundle retention marking MUST be treated as having
   value 12.

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  Concerns About the Manipulation of the Extension Block

   There is a concern that intermediate nodes may intentionally or
   unintentionally alter the information contained in the UQEB.  This
   may result in bundles being forwarded in the incorrect order, or
   dropped inappropriately.  Such manipulation could even be used to
   deny service to legitimate traffic or to gain preferential treatment
   for unauthorized bundles.  Therefore, the integrity and authenticity
   protection of the UQEB MUST be ensured.  BPSec as specified in
   [RFC9172] SHOULD be used, unless an external system can provide the
   same degree of protection.

4.2.  Concerns About Malicious Behavior

   The UQEB indicated desired handling and forwarding behavior, which
   could be exploited by malicious actors to monopolize network
   resources.  For example, a malicious node could mark all bundles as
   expedited in order to monopolize link capacity, or repeatedly request
   retransmission in extremely asymmetric links, congesting the network
   segment.  To prevent this, implementations SHOULD include mechanisms
   such as authentication of the originating node, access controls that
   restrict use of certain QoS parameters, and rate-limiting on users
   marked as suspicious of being malicious or abusive.  Nodes SHOULD
   also apply local or network checks to determine whether a requesting
   user is authorized to receive particular QoS capabilities.  If a UQEB
   is found to violate policy constraints, implementations SHOULD ignore
   the requested handling.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following sections detail the creation of five new IANA
   registries:
